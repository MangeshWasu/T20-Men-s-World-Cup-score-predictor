# T20-Men-s-World-Cup-score-predictor

Developed a t20 score prediction model using regression technique, includes Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor.

Employed a robustness technique using Stratified K-Fold learning to ensure model accuracy and minimize overfitting.

Achieved a high level of accuracy with R2 score of 98.82% and mean absolute error of 1.516

Used yaml dataset, handled the yaml dataset and converting it into pandas data frame. Feature engineering  and feature extraction is the one of the most important part in this project.
